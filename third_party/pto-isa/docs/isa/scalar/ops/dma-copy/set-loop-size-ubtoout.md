# pto.set_loop_size_ubtoout

`pto.set_loop_size_ubtoout` is part of the [DMA Copy](../../dma-copy.md) instruction set.

## Summary

Configure the inner and outer loop counts that the UB→GM DMA engine will use for subsequent transfers.

## Mechanism

This operation programs the UB→GM DMA loop-count registers. Later `pto.copy_ubuf_to_gm` instructions consume these loop counters to build a two-level nested transfer schedule: loop2 surrounds loop1, and loop1 surrounds the per-row burst engine.

## Syntax

### PTO Assembly Form

```text
set_loop_size_ubtoout %loop1_count, %loop2_count : i64, i64
```

### AS Level 1 (SSA)

```mlir
pto.set_loop_size_ubtoout %loop1_count, %loop2_count : i64, i64
```

## Inputs

| Operand | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| %loop1_count | `i64` | Inner hardware-loop iteration count |
| %loop2_count | `i64` | Outer hardware-loop iteration count |

## Expected Outputs

| Result | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `—` | This form only updates the UB→GM DMA loop-count configuration state. |

## Side Effects

Programs the loop-count state consumed by subsequent UB→GM DMA copies. The configuration remains in effect until another loop-size operation overrides it.

## Constraints

- Both counts MUST be non-negative and within the width supported by the target profile.
- When multi-level looping is not needed, both counts SHOULD be set to 1.
- The configured counts apply only to later UB→GM DMA operations and do not retroactively affect already-issued copies.

## Exceptions

- The verifier rejects illegal operand shapes, unsupported pipe or event identifiers, and attribute combinations that are not valid for the selected instruction set or target profile.
- Any additional illegality stated in the constraints section is also part of the contract.

## Target-Profile Restrictions

- CPU simulation preserves the visible configuration contract but may not expose all hardware loop hazards.
- A2/A3 and A5 may use different concrete register widths or reset behavior; portable code must follow the documented PTO contract plus the selected target profile.

## Examples

```mlir
pto.set_loop_size_ubtoout %loop1_count, %loop2_count : i64, i64
```
